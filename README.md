## Introduction

Understanding customer personality traits can provide deep insights into their behavior and preferences. This project utilizes Power BI to visualize and analyze customer data, focusing on key personality indicators.

## Objectives

- To segment customers based on their personality traits.
- To identify patterns and trends within each customer segment.
- To provide actionable insights for enhancing marketing strategies and customer engagement.

## Data Preparation

Data preparation steps involved in this project include:

1. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting errors, and standardizing formats.
2. Data Transformation: Creating new features, normalizing data, and aggregating information.
3. Data Integration: Merging different datasets to create a comprehensive view.

## Analysis

The analysis focuses on clustering customers based on personality traits using techniques such as K-means clustering, and visualizing the results to identify distinct segments.

## Visualizations

Key visualizations included in this Power BI report are:

- **Customer Segmentation Dashboard**: An overview of the different customer segments.
